# Business Problem

## Goal of every data project is to generate or create value for the businesses 



### A client who is passionate about music industry and he wants to understand it by 
### collecting different data so that he can find some patterns and make music based 
### on that

### after exploring all the playlists in the spotify
### he decided to start with 'top songs-global' playlist

### as this playtist updates on weekly basis, will automate it for weekly basis 

## for getting API, we used developer spotify website

## now we need to create for row in data loop 
## then converting the dictionary into dataframe


# Tech Stack used : Python, 
## SpotifyAPI, 
## AWS CloudWatch (trigger service, monitoring, logs, events data to take automated actions), 
## Glue (visually create, run & montior etl workflows), 
## Crawler (understands data, no of row and columns )

## remember that never share client secret from any api 
## DWH like snowflake, redshift, bigquery
